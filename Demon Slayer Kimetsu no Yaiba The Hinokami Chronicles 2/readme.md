> [!NOTE]
This mod is WIP (Work In Progress). This mean that issues like jump speedup exists and are not fixed yet.

You can see a **gameplay test [here](https://youtu.be/T1AhhGsoH70?si=9ZAUUJDJdmON49CM)**

**THIS IS NOT AN EXEFS MOD (.pchtxt)** it's a cheat (.txt)

The reason why I'm sharing the cheat instead is due to the .pchtxt version issues are worse than the cheat (all movement is speedup)
